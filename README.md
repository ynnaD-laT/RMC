Rate My Course Project 
This project is a web application designed to allow college students to search for courses, leave feedback, and request new courses. I developed the backend using Flask (a Python web framework) and SQLite for database management. The app supports user registration, login, session management, course search, comment submission with sentiment-based rating, and an admin panel to review course requests.
